PearCoin is a memecoin for the use of a small, closed group of people.  <br /><br />
It uses Python for the full nodes, and an app written in Dart/Flutter for user interaction (partial-nodes). <br />
PearCoin uses a proof of work mining algorithm, and is designed to store the user's Public/Private keypair in the
network itself, encrypted with a password that the user can then use to decypt their keys and then use to make transactions. <br />
This new system gives PearCoin the benefit of having a vastly greater degree of user-friendliness than traditional cryptocurrencies, however, security issues will almost certainly arise as a consequence. The new issues will be dealt with in the future, but due to the coin's non-critical nature, these flaws do not pose much of a concern.<br /><br />
