PearCoin is a memecoin for the use of a small, closed group of people.  <br /><br />
It uses Python for the full nodes, and an app written in Dart/Flutter for user interaction (half-nodes). <br /> 
There will also be a Python thin client available (using Tkinter lib) <br />
PearCoin uses a proof of work mining algorithm. <br />
