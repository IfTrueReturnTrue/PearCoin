PearCoin is a memecoin for a small and closed group of people's use.  <br /><br />
It uses Python for the full nodes, and an app written in Dart/Flutter for user interaction (partial-nodes) <br />
PearCoin uses a proof of work mining algorithm, and is designed to store the user's Public/Private keypair in the <br />
network itself, encrypted with a password that the user can then use to decypt their keys and use them to make transactions. <br /><br />
